# AWS Amplify Deployment Checklist

## ‚úÖ What's Been Fixed

### Build Configuration
- ‚úÖ `amplify.yml` created with proper build specification
- ‚úÖ Next.js config optimized for Amplify (removed ECS settings)
- ‚úÖ Security headers added for production
- ‚úÖ Build process completes successfully

### Authentication Setup
- ‚úÖ NextAuth configured for Google OAuth only
- ‚úÖ Removed problematic Microsoft provider
- ‚úÖ Environment variables documented

## üö® Critical Steps for Successful Deployment

### 1. **Set Environment Variables in Amplify Console**

**Go to AWS Amplify Console ‚Üí Your App ‚Üí App settings ‚Üí Environment variables**

Add these variables:
```
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-amplify-domain.amplifyapp.com
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secure-random-string-here
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
NODE_ENV=production
```

### 2. **Configure Google OAuth**

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials
3. Add authorized redirect URI:
   ```
   https://your-amplify-domain.amplifyapp.com/api/auth/callback/google
   ```

### 3. **Redeploy in Amplify**

1. In Amplify Console, click **"Redeploy this version"**
2. Monitor build logs
3. Check for environment variable errors

## üîç Common Deployment Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Build failed - missing environment variables"
**Solution**: Add all required environment variables in Amplify Console

### Issue: "Authentication error - invalid redirect URI"
**Solution**: Add your Amplify domain to Google OAuth authorized redirects

### Issue: "NEXTAUTH_URL mismatch"
**Solution**: Ensure NEXTAUTH_URL exactly matches your Amplify domain

### Issue: "localStorage is not defined" during build
**Solution**: This is expected during build and won't affect runtime

## üìã Files Ready for Deployment

### New Files Created
- `amplify.yml` - Build specification
- `amplify-environment.md` - Environment setup guide
- `AMPLIFY_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Complete deployment guide

### Modified Files (No UI/Functionality Impact)
- `next.config.mjs` - Optimized for Amplify
- `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` - Fixed provider configuration

## ‚úÖ Deployment Status

**Build Status**: ‚úÖ READY
- ‚úÖ Build completes successfully
- ‚úÖ Amplify configuration created
- ‚úÖ Environment variables documented
- ‚úÖ Zero UI/functionality changes

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Set Environment Variables** in Amplify Console
2. **Configure Google OAuth** with your domain
3. **Redeploy** using Amplify Console
4. **Monitor** build logs for success

## üö® Important Reminders

- **No UI Changes**: All existing functionality preserved
- **No Code Changes**: Only deployment configuration modified
- **Environment Variables**: Must be set in Amplify Console
- **Google OAuth**: Must include your Amplify domain

## üìû If Deployment Still Fails

1. Check Amplify build logs for specific errors
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure Google OAuth is properly configured
4. Confirm NEXTAUTH_URL matches your domain exactly
5. Check that no UI/functionality was accidentally modified

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

Deployment is successful when:
- ‚úÖ Build completes without errors
- ‚úÖ Application loads in browser
- ‚úÖ Authentication works with Google OAuth
- ‚úÖ All existing UI/functionality works as before
