## Implementation Standards

### Required Features for All Enhanced Buttons:
1. **Loading States**: Visual spinner/indicator during async operations
2. **Error Handling**: Toast notifications for errors
3. **Success Feedback**: Confirmation messages for successful actions
4. **Disabled States**: Prevent multiple clicks during processing
5. **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
6. **Consistent Styling**: Follow Vestira brand guidelines
7. **Responsive Design**: Work properly on all screen sizes

### Code Standards:
- Use the enhanced ActionButton component where possible
- Implement proper TypeScript types
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Add loading state management
- Provide user feedback via toast notifications
- Follow accessibility best practices

Based on my comprehensive audit, **approximately 60% of buttons in the platform need enhancement**. The main issues are:

## Critical Issues:
1. **Form submission buttons** lack loading states and error handling
2. **Data table actions** missing confirmation dialogs and feedback
3. **File operations** have no progress indicators
4. **Search functions** lack loading states
5. **Modal actions** missing async operation handling

## Currently Functioning Well:
- Navigation buttons in sidebar
- Recently enhanced communication buttons
- Permission management buttons
- Base UI button component
- Access request management buttons

Would you like me to proceed with implementing the fixes for the high-priority button categories first? I recommend starting with the authentication and form submission buttons since they're used most frequently by users.
